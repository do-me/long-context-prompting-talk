The dataset is generated from the interferometric analysis of Sentinel-1 radar images at full resolution (20x5 m).   EGMS Basic is visualised as a vector map of measurement points colour-coded by average line-of-sight velocity and distributed to users in comma-separated values format. Each point is associated with a time series of displacement, i.e. a plot with values of displacement per acquisition of the satellite.

       "2    Provides InSAR displacement data provided in the satellite Line-of-Sight, with annotated geo-localisation and quality measures per measurement point. The dataset is generated from the interferometric analysis of Sentinel-1 radar images at full resolution (20x5 m).   EGMS Basic is visualised as a vector map of measurement points colour-coded by average line-of-sight velocity and distributed to users in comma-separated values format. Each point is associated with a time series of displacement, i.e. a plot with values of displacement per acquisition of the satellite. The dataset is generated for both ascending and descending orbits.    \n",

The dataset is generated from the interferometric analysis of Sentinel-1 radar images at full resolution (20x5 m).   EGMS Basic is visualised as a vector map of measurement points colour-coded by average line-of-sight velocity and distributed to users in comma-separated values format. Each point is associated with a time series of displacement, i.e. a plot with values of displacement per acquisition of the satellite.
