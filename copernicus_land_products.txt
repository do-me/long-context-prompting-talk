European Ground Motion Service: GNSS model (vector), Europe, 2-yearly
Satellite interferometry offers detailed, local-scale measurements (up to tens of kilometres) that are relative to specific spatial references, while global navigation satellite system (GNSS) provides absolute spatial data over larger extents. Utilizing the synergistic capabilities of satellite interferometry and GNSS, EGMS provides high-resolution local measurements across a broad spatial scale. The GNSS velocity model is derived from 4716 GNSS stations around Europe using state of the art geodetic methodologies. It is a 50-km gridded model that it is delivered as comma-separated values file. Each grid cell is identified by latitude and longitude coordinates and by the values of the three components of the velocity with their quality parameters.

European Ground Motion Service: Ortho 2019-2023 (vector), Europe, yearly
The EGMS Ortho exploits the information provided by ascending and descending orbits of the EGMS Calibrated to derive two further layers; one of purely vertical displacements (EGMS Ortho Vertical), the other of purely east-west displacements (EGMS Ortho East/West). Both layers are resampled to a 100 m grid, so that the final resolution is 100 by 100 m. EGMS Ortho is visualised as a vector map of measurement points colour-coded by average velocity (vertical or east-west components) and distributed to users in comma-separated values format. Each point is associated with a time series of displacement, i.e. a plot with values of displacement per acquisition of the satellite.
